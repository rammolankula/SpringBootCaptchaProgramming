#### Application for Recaptcha

<pre>
Spring ReCaptcha same as above but We need to follow some instructions like site-Key and seceret-key for using reCaptcha
&#8594; Here we no need to write any logic for recaptcha Example :in Service Layer or Controller no need to write
&#8594; Write simple CURD operation same as above i.e 1st application
&#8594; In the Register page, it is necessary to first register on the reCAPTCHA portal before incorporating the secret key. 
&#8594;  As an example, the following code snippet should be added to the Register page after obtaining the required registration on the reCAPTCHA portal.
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-2">
  <label>VALIDATE</label>
</div>
<div class="col-4">
  <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="6LeIxAcTAAAAAJcZVRqyHh71UMIEGNQ_MXjiZKhI"></div>
</div>
